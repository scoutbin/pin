# AGENTS.md

pin audits system behaviour in a lockfile.

- Built on spine (`github.com/scoutbin/spine`): `spine.json` is the tool descriptor, releases come from spine's reusable workflows.

## Repo rules

- The scoutbin org is on GitHub's free plan. Do not rely on paid features.
- Make minimal changes.
- Confirm before any action with side effects, such as pushing, tagging, publishing or editing repo settings.
- Keep commit messages short and imperative. No ticket prefix, no AI or co-author trailers.
- Write tests table-driven, using `testcases` arrays with no duplicated structure.
